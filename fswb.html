   <h2 id="story" >Artemis 1 is the first mission in NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon by 2025. The mission will send an uncrewed Orion spacecraft around the moon and back to Earth.It was launched <mark>on December 20, 2022,from Launch Complex 39B </mark>at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.It was the first launch of the Space Launch System (SLS), the most powerful rocket ever built by NASA. The Orion spacecraft traveled over 6.6 million miles during its journey around the moon. It returned to Earth safely on March 1, 2023 .The Artemis 1 mission was a success, and it paved the way for future crewed missions to the moon,</h2>

<section id="Milkyway">
<h2 id="galaxy">The Milky Way is a mystery to the naked eye. It appears as a faint cloud across the night sky, but it is actually a vast spiral galaxy made up of billions of stars. The most massive stars in the galaxy are found in the central bulge. These stars are very bright and hot, and they can live for only a few million years before they explode as supernovae.The disk of the Milky Way is home to a wide variety of stars, including young stars, old stars, and stars of all sizes. The young stars are found in the spiral arms, where there is plenty of gas and dust for them to form. The old stars are found in the central bulge and in the halo, which is the spherical region of space around the galaxy.The Milky Way is also home to a large amount of gas and dust. This gas and dust is essential for star formation, as it provides the raw materials for stars to form. The gas and dust in the Milky Way is constantly being stirred up by the motion of the stars and by supernova explosions. This stirring up helps to create new stars and to keep the galaxy evolving.The Milky Way is a beautiful and complex galaxy, and it is still a mystery to many astronomers. The Milky Way is home to a supermassive black hole at its center called <mark>Sagittarius A*</mark>. This black hole has a mass of about 4 million suns and is about 40 light-years across. It is so massive that its gravity bends the light of stars that pass near it.Sagittarius A* is the closest supermassive black hole to Earth. It is so close that it is actually within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. This means that we have a unique opportunity to study it in detail. Scientists are still learning about Sagittarius A*, but they believe that it is the engine that powers the Milky Way. The black hole's gravity pulls in gas and dust, which heats up and forms stars. These stars then emit light and heat, which helps to keep the galaxy warm.With a telescope, we can see the Milky Way for what it truly is. The stars in the Milky Way are so far away that they appear to merge together into a single band of light. But through a telescope, we can see the individual stars and star clusters that make up our galaxy.The Milky Way is a reminder of our place in the universe. We are just one small part of a vast and beautiful galaxy.</h2>

    <h1>History  Of Human Exploration Of Mars</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Humans have been fascinated by Mars for centuries. The first recorded observations of Mars were made by ancient Babylonian astronomers in the 2nd millennium BC.In the 17th century, Italian astronomer <mark>Giovanni Schiaparelli</mark> observed what he thought were canals on Mars, sparking speculation that the planet might be inhabited.The first robotic mission to Mars was the Mariner 4 flyby in 1965. Mariner 4 took the first close-up images of Mars, revealing a barren and rocky planet. The Viking landers, which touched down on Mars in 1976, were the first missions to search for signs of life on Mars. Although they found no definitive evidence of life, the Viking landers made significant discoveries about the Martian environment.In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in sending humans to Mars. NASA is currently developing the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft, which will be used to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. The European Space Agency (ESA) is also planning a mission to Mars, called ExoMars, which will launch in 2022.</p>

 <p>There are many challenges to sending humans to Mars. One of the biggest challenges is the long travel time. It takes about six months to travel between Earth and Mars. This means that astronauts would have to spend a long time in space, which would expose them to radiation and microgravity. Another challenge is the harsh Martian environment. Mars is a cold, dry, and dusty place with a thin atmosphere. This means that astronauts would need to wear protective suits whenever they went outside. There are many potential benefits to sending humans to Mars. One of the biggest benefits is the discovery of new life. Mars may have once been habitable, and there is still a chance that life exists on the planet today. Sending humans to Mars would give us the best chance of finding life beyond Earth.NASA and other space agencies are developing new technologies to overcome the challenges of sending humans to Mars. One of the most important technologies is the SLS, which will be the most powerful rocket ever built. The SLS will be able to carry the heavy payload needed for a Mars mission.Another important technology is the life support system. This system will provide astronauts with the air, water, and food they need to survive on Mars. The life support system will also need to be able to recycle waste and remove carbon dioxide from the air.</p>

<h1 id="last">Future Of Human Exploration Of Mars </h1>
<p id="lastp"> Human exploration of Mars is a long-term goal of many space agencies around the world. NASA has set a goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s, and the <mark>European Space Agency (ESA)</mark>is also planning a human mission to Mars in the same decade.There are many challenges that will need to be overcome before humans can safely travel to Mars and live there for extended periods of time. One of the biggest challenges is the distance. It takes about six months to travel between Earth and Mars, which means that astronauts would have to spend a long time in space. They would also be exposed to harmful radiation during the journey.Despite the challenges, there are many reasons to believe that human exploration of Mars is possible in the near future. We have the technology to travel to Mars, and we are constantly developing new technologies that will make it safer and easier to travel to and live on Mars. We also have the resources to support a human mission to Mars, and there is a growing international consensus that human exploration of Mars is a worthwhile goal.In the near future, we can expect to see more robotic missions to Mars. These missions will help us to learn more about the Martian environment and to prepare for human exploration. We can also expect to see the development of new technologies that will make human exploration of Mars safer and easier.In the 2030s, we can expect to see the first human missions to Mars. These missions will be short-term, but they will lay the groundwork for longer-term human exploration. We can also expect to see the development of new habitats and life support systems that will make it possible for humans to live on Mars for extended periods of time.

<h2 id="lasth">"I think Mars is the next logical step for human exploration. It's the only planet in our solar system that has the potential to support life."</h2>
<h2 id="lasts">-Chris Hadfield</h2>
<p id="lastp">
In the 2040s and beyond, we can expect to see the establishment of a permanent human presence on Mars. This presence will be made possible by advances in technology and by the development of a sustainable economy on Mars. A permanent human presence on Mars would allow us to explore the planet more fully and to learn more about its history and potential for life. It would also allow us to develop new technologies that could benefit humanity on Earth.The future of human exploration of Mars is bright. With continued investment in research and development, we can make human exploration of Mars a reality in the near future. This would be a major milestone for humanity, and it would open up a new chapter in our exploration of the universe.
